# This is called by sway; and should (re)start services that only make sense to run in a graphical session.
# Services that contribute to the basic gui, like waybar, should be restarted here; which makes them restart whenever sway does.
# This is not put in /usr/local/bin because that is the domain of the systemfiles repo, and this functionality should work on computers with only dotfiles installed, not systemfiles. It's practically a part of the sway config, but I split it out so that the sway config file wouldn't need to have many branch-specific differences.
