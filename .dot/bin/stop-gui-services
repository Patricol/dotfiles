# This is called by i3; and should stop less important services that were started by start-gui-services.
# Services that contribute to the basic gui, like polybar, should not be stopped here. Also include oneshot services in case they are changed in the future.
# This is not put in /usr/local/bin because that is the domain of the systemfiles repo, and this functionality should work on computers with only dotfiles installed, not systemfiles. It's practically a part of the i3 config, but I split it out so that the i3 config file wouldn't need to have many branch-specific differences.
