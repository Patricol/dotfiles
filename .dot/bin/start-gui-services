# This is called by i3; and should (re)start services that only make sense to run in a graphical session.
# Services that contribute to the basic gui, like polybar, should be restarted here; which makes them restart whenever i3 does.
# This is not put in /usr/local/bin because that is the domain of the systemfiles repo, and this functionality should work on computers with only dotfiles installed, not systemfiles. It's practically a part of the i3 config, but I split it out so that the i3 config file wouldn't need to have many branch-specific differences.
